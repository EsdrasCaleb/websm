For a README for "websm," here's a suggestion that outlines the project's purpose, features, setup, and contribution guidelines. As for licensing, the Mozilla Public License (MPL) is a good choice since it's less restrictive than GPLv3, allowing more flexibility. If you're comfortable with that, you can proceed with MPL. Otherwise, GPLv3 would be a suitable alternative if you want to ensure derivative works also use an open license.

# websm: Web Systematic Review Tool

websm (Web Systematic Review) is an open-source tool designed to aid researchers in conducting systematic reviews using BERT-based zero-shot classification directly on the client side. This project aims to streamline the process of categorizing academic articles or other research documents, improving efficiency and user experience.

## Features

- **BERT-Based Classification**: Uses TensorFlow.js and BERT to provide in-browser classification of articles.
- **Pagination and User-Friendly Interface**: Display data in a paginated table, making it easier to browse through large datasets.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All computations are done on the client side, ensuring data privacy.
- **BibTeX Import**: Upload a BibTeX file and visualize data for systematic review.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account to fork/clone the repository.
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and React.
- Node.js and npm installed locally.
